# Background

> For creators of technology, educating users is often a challenge. Some creators tend to introduce formal courses, while some others rely on users referencing documentation and trial-and-error. In some, third parties have created learning materials like weblog tutorials or even reference examples. 
> 
> When considering the traits of technologies, a pattern appears to emerge: those that are rapidly-changing like augmented reality and artificial intelligence seem to depend on informal education. For these, often documentation and a sample are all the materials provided. Looking at more established topics like desktop computing and service management, the case is quite different. Corresponding certifications exist like CompTIA A+ and ITIL Foundation with accompanying curriculum and a network of professional teachers. The options vary greatly as the technology's maturity level changes.

# Work Status

Consistent with the published [project plan](http://turnrye.com/cs6460-turnrye/project-plan/index.html), this project is on schedule. The questionnaire survey has completed distribution, and some preliminary results have been compiled. The raw survey responses have been uploaded to [the repository](http://turnrye.com/cs6460-turnrye/survey-responses.csv). The next step is to complete the interview surveys.

# Interview Survey

The interview survey asks questions about specific scenarios in which learning occurs. Less focus is given on what tools are used, but more focus is given on the antecedents and consequences of the learning. It will take place over Google Hangouts. Standard interview procedures will be followed [@interviews]. Care is taken to ensure respondents don't need to consult records. This research method will permit judging the quality of response, unlike the questionnaire survey. Additionally, open-ended questions are used to help introduce additional data. The script for this interview is located below in [Survey Script](#survey Script).

## Survey Script

> The following interview survey questions are to be conducted in a video chat with the participant. Open by introducing yourself and reading the statement below.
>
> This survey is being conducted as part of a class project on educational technology in graduate studies at the Georgia Institute of Technology. We expect that the interview will take approximately 15 minutes. Please note that your responses may be referenced in our work, however there will be no personally identifiable information shared. This work is considered an informal pilot study, and there is no compensation for participation. Your time is appreciated as we investigate how people learn rapidly changing frameworks.
