For my project this semester in CS6460, I will research how React Native compares to traditional native app development in three aspects: the end user's perception of quality, the speed of the software development life cycle, and adoption in popular applications. In order to address this question, multiple research techniques are required. Borrowing from other existing research, most of these analyses have been done, but instead for more traditional hybrid development frameworks. React Native is significantly different in the way in which development takes place as well as its performance and feature set. The rest of this writing will focus first on the existing research as it exists, why React Native is significantly different and demands the research be repeated, and end with the tasks that will take place in order to answer these questions.

## Existing Research on Hybrid Mobile App Development

## Distinguishing React Native from Other Hybrid Frameworks

- Open framework
- JavaScript + native
- Focus on performance
- Big community of modules

## Research Approach
