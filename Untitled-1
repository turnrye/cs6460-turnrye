Then, explore in more depth the other work going on in the specific area you want to work on. If you’re interested in doing some research, you might want to look at what the dominant theories are in this area, as well as the types of methods (e.g. quantitative or qualitative) that are usually used.

Your goal with this research is to properly position your work so that it contributes to what others have done, builds on the lessons they have learned, and contributes something worthwhile. End your assignment by stating, at a high level, the problem you want to explore: Is there some unanswered question in the research community (research track)?

The main goal of this assignment is for you to learn about the community in which you’re interested in participating. The secondary goals are for you to have the background necessary to select teammates, to provide your mentor and classmates with the information necessary to help you find more material, and to have you learned to drive your own research into a topic.
