# Introduction

 Some background on what it is you're talking about. Typically, this will include a cursory literature review just to define the problem area. It will culminate in the question the paper is answering or the problem the paper is solving, typically followed by a brief summary of the contribution itself.

# Related Work

What is the context of the work? Who else is working on the same sorts of problems or questions? How is this work different? How does this work contribute to the broader field? A strong related work section is the underappreciated foundation of a good paper: it tells the reader exactly where this contribution sits in a broader narrative. This goes back to the first few weeks of this course: the entire reason why we asked you to go so far into the literature was so you could make a case that your work contributes to the field, rather than reinventing the wheel or making the same mistakes as others.

# Solution

If you built something, typically what follows is a description of what you built and why it was designed the way it was.

# Methodology

If you built something, you generally need to test it and prove some positive results before it will be accepted for a full publication (it may be accepted for a shorter, lighter contribution based on implementation alone if it's particularly novel, but for a high-impact contribution there typically needs to be some evaluation). The methodology tells how you tested it. If, on the other hand, you were researching some question, the methodology tells the reader how you set about answering it. The important thing about the methodology is that exists separate and before the results: it tells the reader why they should trust the results.

# Results

What was the result of the investigation or evaluation? This is typically what the entire paper is building toward: some assertion that the solution worked or some answer to the question that was raised.

# Limitations

Another underappreciated section of any strong paper: the limitations section clearly articulates exactly how generalizable the conclusions are. For example, if work was done in the context of a middle school, then the results may only be generalizable to middle schools. If there were clear potential lurking variables in the methodology, then those would be disclosed here. The importance of the limitations section is that it clearly and honestly articulates how far the contribution goes. In my experience, any limitation you identify will not be held against your paper, but if the reviewers have limitations you don't acknowledge, they'll be far more reluctant to accept the contribution. This is what separates research from advertising.

# Conclusion

A summary, basically. Reiterate the context, the problem, the solution, the results, and the limitations.

# Future Work

Make a bunch of false promises about what you're going to do next. (I kid, but generally, I don't see much value in Future Work sections: they usually raise big questions that the authors have no intent on answering, and I've rarely seen a paper receive feedback asking for more future work, even if none was included in the first place.)
