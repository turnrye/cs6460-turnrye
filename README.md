# Learning Rapidly Changing Frameworks

In the summer term of 2018, I studied CS6460 at Georgia Institute of Technology; during this course, I researched how developers learn rapidly changing frameworks. This is closely related to just-in-time learning and informal learning. Below are the various work products of this research, working in what I believe is order of most interesting to least interesting.

## Paper

The [final paper](final-paper/paper.pdf) represents the culmination of this effort. It contains the writing associated with this pilot research and is one of the final deliverables for the CS6460 course.

## Research

The research data is available end-to-end. The [survey questions](questionnaire-survey-script.pdf) are available for review. The [raw survey responses](survey-results/survey-responses-original.csv) are available, as well as the [source of the Pandas script](survey-results/stats.py) that generated the various results ([1](survey-results/best_tool.pdf), [2](survey-results/completion_by_tool.pdf), [3](survey-results/how_soon_was_it_used.pdf), [4](survey-results/learning_in_response_to_change.pdf), [5](survey-results/tool_usage.pdf)). Many more resources are available, and I suggest browsing the repository to review these additional materials.

An additional interview survey was proposed and attempted, however due to lack of participation it did not contribute to the overall paper. The [script for the survey](interview-survey-script.md) is available in this repository as well.

## Coursework
