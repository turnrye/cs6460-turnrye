# Learning Rapidly Changing Frameworks

In the summer term of 2018, I studied CS6460 at Georgia Institute of Technology; during this course, I researched how developers learn rapidly changing frameworks. This is closely related to just-in-time learning and informal learning. Below are the various work products of this research, working in what I believe is order of most interesting to least interesting.

## Paper

The [final paper](final-paper/paper.pdf) represents the culmination of this effort. It contains the writing associated with this pilot research and is one of the final deliverables for the CS6460 course.

## Research

The research data is available end-to-end. The [survey questions](survey-questions.pdf) are available for review. The [raw survey responses](survey-results/survey-responses-original.csv) are available, as well as the [source of the Pandas script](survey-results/stats.py) that generated the various results ([1](survey-results/best_tool.pdf), [2](survey-results/completion_by_tool.pdf), [3](survey-results/how_soon_was_it_used.pdf), [4](survey-results/learning_in_response_to_change.pdf), [5](survey-results/tool_usage.pdf)). Many more resources are available, and I suggest browsing the repository to review these additional materials.

## Coursework

The coursework for this is available. The raw writing and references are available in markdown and bibtex format in the [coursework folder](coursework). The generated PDFs are available below:
