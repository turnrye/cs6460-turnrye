This project will conduct research on how people learn about software development. Specifically, how people who identify as developers (with some previous level of training or experience) go about learning dynamic and growing topics. This proposal will describe the research problem and its concerns, discuss the key deliverables of the work, and provide a coded work breakdown structure with a calendar.

# Research Problem

For creators of technology, educating users is often a challenge. Some creators tend to introduce formal certification courses, while some others rely on users referencing documentation and trial and error. In some, third parties have created learning materials like weblog tutorials or even reference examples. When considering the topic area, a pattern appears to emerge: those that are rapidly-changing like augmented reality and artificial intelligence seem to depend on informal education. For these, often documentation and a sample are all the materials provided. Looking at more established topics like desktop computing and service management, the case is quite different. Certifications like CompTIA A+ and ITIL Foundation have accompanying curriculum and a network of professional teachers. The options vary greatly across all of technology.

Rapidly-changing topics seem to be learned in fragmented, difficult to measure ways. This research will focus on the following problem:

**How do developers learn rapidly-changing platforms?**

To answer this question, the "where, when, and why" are considered. Specifically, the three following research questions will be investigated:

**RQ1: What learning tools are preferred?**

Understanding what tools are preferred helps to show what traits developers prefer in their tools, as well as what platforms content creators choose to use for teaching. In pursuing this, various tools for learning will be considered. Some examples include institution-sponsored courses, massive open online courses (MOOCs), books, weblog tutorials, forum and knowledge market threads, workshops, and even hackathons. This can answer what structures best suit rapidly-changing platforms. This detail represents where the learning occurs.

**RQ2: Is their learning motivated by a pressing need?**

When working with rapidly changing frameworks, developers may choose to learn "just-in-time" to solve a problem so as to avoid volatility. Other developers may instead respond to rapid change by closely following progress, proactively learning new materials. These two lend themselves to different kinds of content: the former needs to be problem based and easily found, whereas the latter needs to be more engaging and use constructionism. This detail represents when the learning occurs.

**RQ3: What scope of knowledge do developers pursue?**

The scope of learning tools widely varies, from weeks-long MOOCs to ten-minute read weblog posts. Learning the scope that developers pursue for their learning, whether it's full courses, individual lectures, or even just individual code snippets answers "why" they are learning: is it to move on with their day, or maybe is it to better understand something they already practice?

## Background literature

In this research, non-institutional learning methods will be analyzed. A specific kind of this is informal learning [@marsick2001informal], which is learning with little structure and often the byproduct of some other activity [@marsick2001informal]. Informal learning is "relevant to practice in many cultures and contexts" and takes "place wherever people have need, motivation, and opportunity for learning" [@marsick2001informal]. While this method is often looked at from a business context [@marsick2001informal; @noe2014learning], motivation could come as uncertainty of creating a new solution or resolving a bug in code. A social component is also defining for informal learning: while the trigger may be considered locally to an individual, it is often the result of an external change such as results of a tester's work or a request from a product owner. Informal learning takes place around all of us day to day.

In looking at how developers learn rapidly-changing platforms, we must start by reviewing their options. Developers have many solutions available for learning (see [Research Problem](#research-problem)). The next paragraphs describe the informal learning activities that take place within a subset of these.

In research of programmers use of tools, @murphy2011peer shows how peer interaction help leads to more discovery. While discovery is more specifically called "the first stage of some kinds of learning," it does pose a potential type of learning for our problem. Murphy-Hill contrasts peer interaction from Marsick's definition of informal learning, however when consider according to the definition proposed above, the distinctions are removed. In this work, Murphy-Hill demonstrates how situations like happenstance interaction, pair programming, and even change notification often result in peer observations and recommendations. These represent the "discoveries" of tools, but in some cases they also represent the teaching material itself: with pair programming, the peer interaction often creates an incidental situated learning experience.

Hackathons are also proposed as "excellent informal learning platforms" [@nandi2016hackathons]. A hackathon is "face-paced event where competitors work in teams to go from an idea to working software or hardware within a single day or a weekend." Like in @murphy2011peer's work, the authors cite peer-learning as common place in this setting. Consistent with the definition of informal learning, at hackathons the problems create the need, the gamification create the motivation, and the industry mentors plus online resources create the opportunity. While this primarily focused on learnings within teams, they also recognize that the learning environment created at a hackathon excels at producing industry-relevant learnings and skills. WMany kinds of learning may occur within a hackathon, but the overall activity itself is stated as "a great opportunity to learn" [@nandi2016hackathons], and to some considered a tool for learning.
