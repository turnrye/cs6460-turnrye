# Research Problem

**How do developers learn hybrid mobile app frameworks, and how are the frameworks perceived by learners?**

**RQ1: Do engineers find learning hybrid development simpler than learning traditional native application development?**

**RQ2: Where do developers learn hybrid development?**

**RQ3: How widely are hybrid mobile app development frameworks used in university programs (both courses and projects)?**

- Description of phenomenon, including RQs
