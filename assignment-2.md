# Ryan Turner's Assignment 2

I'd like to focus on a research track for this course. This was a rather straight forward decision for me, as in the past I've worked on both materials and development of educational tech: I did this as part of my job to help onboard new team members. In my undergraduate studies, I worked in a biology research lab helping with bioinformatics. I did not have the chance to participate in any of the writing; given the opportunity today, I'd like to do that.

Recently, I've begun working as a community team member on the React Native project. This is an open-source hybrid mobile development framework created by Facebook. My contributions to date have been in organizing and writing the changelog and managing the channel for community release discussion. What I've anecdotally observed is that students learn React Native far differently from other mobile frameworks. I plan to focus on the following aspects of learning hybrid mobile development:

**How do developers learn the React Native framework, and how is it perceived by its learners?**

**RQ1: Do engineers find learning React Native development simpler than learning traditional native application development?**

**RQ2: Where do developers learn React Native development?**

**RQ3: How widely are hybrid mobile app development frameworks included in university undergraduate programs, like lesson plans and course projects?**

@que2016 inspired the first question, however I found a number of the conclusions made to be unsubstantiated. Many presumptions were made regarding the ease of developing using JavaScript and HTML when compared with native app languages like Objective-C and Java. While I personally agree with these statements, I didn't find comfort in these statements being made without evidence of citation, survey, or study. I also found that from time to time the author referred to applications written with the Cordova as being developed in HTML5, which didn't honestly represent the effort – while UI is written in HTML, the functionality is written in JavaScript. I think RQ1 warrants further research.

The second research question was motivated by my own personal experience. In my university studies, I had learned iOS development, and here at the OMSCS program I've had the opportunity to learn Android development. Partly this is due to what materials and resources exist from the platforms themselves [@iosdeveloperuniversityprogram, @googledeveloperstraining]. I've also found Cordova and PhoneGap used in university projects. However, despite frequent use in industry, I've not found instances of React Native in a higher education setting. So, I'm interested to learn where developers are learning React Native. There are many online resources for this, however most are quickly out of date or low quality (once again, first hand knowledge). This question will look at both traditional school resources and online courses.

The third research question comes to help ground the rest of the research. For instance, if RQ2 turns out to scarcely mention university studies, we may find that it is not due to poor student learning outcomes but rather lack of exposure. I did find examples of courses and curriculums teaching both native iOS and Android development [@payne2014teaching, @sprinkle2011teaching] as well as honing in on a single platform (typically Android, since unlike iOS, development can take place on any computer) [@mahmoud2010mobile]. However, there were no examples of courses teaching hybrid app development that I could find. I instead suspect that students may be self-teaching, even when used for a project in a course.
